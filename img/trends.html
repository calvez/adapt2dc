      <h2>2.1. Demographic trends in Europe</h2>
      <p>Today’s demographic changes – population ageing, the slowing down of population growth and the decrease in the growth rate of the working age population – are among the most serious challenges Europe will face in the upcoming decades. Shrinking regions and cities are more and more diffused across the EU, although with a ’great diversity in terms of demographic dynamics and patterns’.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>  This will be a risk for European competitiveness since the increase of working age population in many other parts of the world is expected to continue. In addition, disparities across European regions may increase. Even though population ageing will affect regions all across Europe, different types of regions will be affected in different ways. In general the level of fertility and the inflow of migrants are high mostly in the more developed regions, whereas in general fertility is low and there is an outflow of young migrants in less developed regions. As a speciality of Central and South-Eastern Europe, there are also less developed regions with high fertility rate (typically small regions, especially under NUTS3 level), with a high share of minorities.</p>

      <h4>Useful terms </h4>
      <ul>
      	<li><strong>Total fertility rate (TFR):</strong> The average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime. It is a synthetic rate based on the age-specific fertility rates of women in their "child-bearing years" ie. 15–49.</li>
      	<li><strong>Replacement level fertility:</strong> The total fertility rate (TFR) that (if sustained) secures the replacement of the current population. In developed countries it is app. 2,1 children per woman.</li>
      	<li><strong>Tempo effect :</strong> The effect of the postponement of childbearing, which results that, fertility rates could decrease in several Member States as women step into their 30s or 40s.</li>
      	<li><strong>Dependency ratio:</strong> The ratio of those typically not in the labour force (the dependent part) and those typically in the labour force (the productive part). It is used to measure the pressure on productive population.</li>
      	<li><strong>Old-age dependency ratio:</strong> The ratio measures the number of elderly people (above 65 years) as a share of those of working age (aged 15-64). As the ratio increases there may be an increased burden on the productive part of the population to maintain the pensions and other costs of the elderly.</li>

      <h3>2.1.1. General European tendencies</h3>
      <p>The population of the European Union has been growing and ageing steadily in the past decades. In 2010 the total population of the European Union crossed the 500 million threshold. The fertility rate of the European Union is 1,6 (2009) which is far below the replacement level. In addition to the pro-population policies that aim to increase reproductivity, there are two factors that can mitigate the effects of low fertility levels, and thus postpone the population decrease of the European Union: the first is increasing life expectancy and the second is migration from countries outside the EU.</p>

      <br>
      <p>Looking at the dynamics of demographic change since the year 2000, there is clear evidence for both processes of <strong>population growth and ageing in the European Union.</strong> In a time span of almost 10 years, the share of the 0-14 age group has diminished significantly, while the share of the elderly – especially of those above age 80 - has grown considerably. These trends show the fact that the <strong>modest population growth of the European Union derives to a greater extent from the high level of migration than from natural population change.</strong> Although the level of net migration has varied significantly over the last ten years, it <strong>was the source of at least two-thirds of the positive population change.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The population of the EU will become significantly older</strong> in the next decades, no matter whether the current low fertility rate increases to the replacement level or whether migration from third countries can counterbalance the natural decrease. <strong>Currently the elderly (above 65) make up 17 per cent among the EU’s inhabitants.</strong> The increasing number of the elderly in the population is a consequence of longer life expectancy which is definitely a positive phenomenon and characterises the increasing quality of life in the European Union. On the other hand, the old-age dependency ratio is currently 25 per cent and it may increase to 50 per cent by 2050, which would definitely <strong>put pressure on public spending</strong> (first and foremost pensions, health care and social services). Ageing and its fiscal and social consequences – summarised in Chapter 2 [link] – affect all the EU countries (though to varying extent).</p>

      <h3>2.1.2. Demographic imbalances</h3>
      <p>Generally speaking the peripheral and sparsely populated areas loose population, while metropolitan regions and regional centres are still attractive. Europe as a whole is more or less involved in a depopulation process, however during the end of 1990s 60% of the regions experienced population increase, both by natural population growth and positive net-migration.  In the 2000s the percentage of regions experiencing population decline has increased to 30 per cent, and the percentage of regions with a high percentage of people aged 65 or over has increased as well. Population growth is unevenly distributed across Europe: between 2000-2008 seven countries of the EU reported population decrease: three Baltic states, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, and Germany. </p>
      <p>Natural growth is negative or stagnating in more than one half (16) of the EU countries since 2000, Ireland was the only exception, where natural growth exceeded 0.5 per cent of the total population per year. A number of regions in all Member States experience a constant decrease of population at a restrained pace, but the fast rate of emigration together with a dropping fertility rate is typical  to most new Member States and the eastern part of Germany. Since 2000 four countries have reported both negative natural growth and negative net migration: Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. In four other countries negative natural growth has been compensated for by positive net migration: Germany, Czech Republic, Italy and Slovenia. In two countries net migration was not enough to counterbalance negative natural growth: Estonia and Hungary.</p>

      <section id="section6" itemprop="articleSection">
      <h3>2.1.3. Natural population change</h3>
      <p>From the 1960s <strong>Total Fertility Rates</strong> (TFR) have declined in every part of Europe and now it is is <strong>far below the replacement level (2.1),</strong> however in most Member States the fertility rate has increased lately (except for Germany and Portugal) most probable because of the tempo effect: women who shifted their childbearing to their 30s or 40s begin to have their children. The fertility rate differs significantly from country to country (ranging from 1.31 in Latvia to 2.07 in Ireland in 2009). Countries with extremely low fertility rates were Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Estonia and Latvia, however there are quite big regional differences.</p>
      <p>There are many theories concerning why the differences in fertility levels exist over Europe. Many focus on the characteristics of the family, gender relations, religion, the possible role of family policies and the possibility of entry in the labour market. Other theories connect it to different welfare state models. The question of culture is also used to explain the differences with regard to fertility among the members of the European Union between East and West, North and South.

      <h3>2.1.4. Ageing, increase in life expectancy</h3>
      <p>
      	Ageing is strongly connected to the growing life expectancy of the European population. According to the Demography Report (2010), the <strong>average life expectancy in the countries of the EU27 in 2009 was 82.4 years for women and 76.4 years for men.</strong> This is the result of a steady increase gained by reducing mortality, made primarily by advancement in healthcare. There is, however, still a <strong>significant East-West divide</strong> in the EU, a divide that particularly concerns men, who can expect to live only to around 65-70 years in eight of the Central and East European Member States, compared to an EU-15 average of more than 76 years. In these countries, mortality among middle-aged men remains high, and this is the main factor behind the large East-West gap in life expectancy. In the Baltic states women live 11 years longer than men, whereas in many western and northern countries the difference is below 5 years.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>The percentage of people aged 65 or over is high in several northern regions (mainly in Sweden), in central regions (mainly in Germany) and in southern regions (in Italy and Spain). The rate of ageing is relatively low in Poland, Ireland and Iceland. Since 2000 the number of <strong>oldest old</strong> (persons over 75) has risen in almost every European regions, without any specific geographical concentration.
      </p>
       <p>As a result, <strong>the old-age dependency ratio,</strong> calculated as the ratio of people aged 65 or above relative to the working-age population aged 15-64, <strong>is projected to more than double in the EU from 25 per cent to 50 per cent in 2050.</strong> The increase is particularly high in Germany, where the working age population has decreased by 3 per cent since 2000, while the number of elderly (65+) increased by 22 per cent. Greece and Italy have experienced a strong increase in the old age dependency ratio as well, but in these countries the working age population has not yet declined.</p>
       <p>This means that <strong>the EU would move from having 4 persons of working-age for every person aged over 65 to a ratio of only 2 to 1.</strong> When adding the number of children to the calculation, the ratio of dependent to active is projected to rise by nearly 30 percentage points. These population trends underpin future trends in the labour market which are of crucial importance for economic growth. An indicator of the challenges ahead is the ratio of non-workers to workers, or the economic dependency ratio.
       <p>As has been stressed in ’Recent demographic developments in Europe’ by the Council of Europe (2002) the European population structure no longer resembles the shape of a pyramid, but rather a snowball. The youngest generations under the age of 20 years have become smaller and smaller. They constitute the smaller future generations of parents, which again leads to a smaller number of births. So <strong>the European population structure, which is already older than most of the countries in the world, shows the characteristic features of further ageing.</strong>

      <h4>What is a shrinking region?</h4>
      </section>
      <p>The concept of ‘shrinking region’ is a recent one, even if the phenomenon is known for a long time. What is essentially new is that depopulation affects entire regions, including urban areas (‘shrinking cities’). The accurate definition of the concept is still subject of debate. Even if the phenomenon of population decline is often linked to ageing, and certain unfavourable economic and social changes, it is preferable to stand by the simplest definition, which is <strong>the reduction in the number of inhabitants of a particular region during a longer time period.</strong> In the framework of the ADAPT2DC project population shrinkage is defined as the <strong>relative decline in the total population size in a NUTS3 region in a ten-year period.</strong></p>
      <p>In line with the definition used by the ADAPT2DC project, the following sub-chapter deals with the demographic aspects of shrinkage (demographic indicators related to population shrinkage: population change, total fertility rate, and components of population change related to shrinking regions and cities). </p>
      <section id="section15" itemprop="articleSection">
      <h4>Population change</h4>

      <p>If we compare the population change between 1991 and 2011 with the population change between 2001 and 2011 we can see that the macro-regional pattern of population growth and shrinkage is relatively stable. At the regional level <strong>population decline has advanced mostly in East German, Polish, and Hungarian regions.</strong> Population decline occurred in <strong>all types of regions – in rural, mixed, and urban regions.</strong> At the macro level, there is a <strong>belt of growing population regions from the Italian north through Austria to south Germany.</strong> These regions rank among regions with a higher GDP per capita and higher disposable income in comparison with other Central European regions. In <strong>Poland, Czech Republic,, Slovenia and Hungary the regions surrounding</strong> national and bigger regional <strong>urban cores are growing,</strong> whereas the <strong>urban cores themeselves might be experiencing population decline. In Slovakia</strong> there are <strong>growing regions in north and east due to younger population structures and higher levels of fertility.</strong></p>
